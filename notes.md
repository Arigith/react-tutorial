Learnt from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVFAyFWO4go&t=0s

command to create a new project:
    npx create-react-app <app-name>
        This command creates folder <app-name> and installs all react dependancies

From the src folder the tutorial does not use App.test.js, reportWebVitals.js or setupTests.js (so I deleted them)
